Using a mechanical keyboard connected to telegraph lines, users could send coded messages displayed on a grid of indicator lamps. The device required hand-cranking for power and used brass components with wooden housing. Despite its bulk and complexity, it revolutionized urban communication.",

Using precisely angled mirrors and oil lamps, it could transmit coded light signals across the city. A mechanical calculator-like interface allowed message composition, while telescope attachments enabled signal reception. Though weather-dependent, it provided near-instantaneous communication across Paris.",
